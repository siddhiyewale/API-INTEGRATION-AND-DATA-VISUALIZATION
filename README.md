Project Title: API Integration and Weather Data Visualization using Python

In this project, I created a Python-based application that integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time 5-day midday weather forecasts for a specified city. Using the requests library, the application fetches weather data in JSON format, which is then parsed and structured using pandas.

The project focuses on extracting temperature and humidity data for each midday forecast and visualizing the trends using Matplotlib. The final output displays a clean, interactive line chart comparing temperature (Â°C) and humidity (%) over five days for a chosen location (e.g., Mumbai, IN).

*Key features* :

API integration and data retrieval using requests

JSON parsing and transformation into readable format

Dynamic plotting using matplotlib.pyplot

Forecast chart includes proper labeling, legends, titles, and date formatting

Console output for raw forecast details

*Tools & Technologies Used* :

Python (v3.12.3)

OpenWeatherMap API

Requests, Pandas

Matplotlib

VS Code (for development)

*Outcome* :
This project demonstrates my ability to combine API handling, data processing, and visual storytelling, enabling users to gain insights from real-time weather data in a meaningful and interactive way.
